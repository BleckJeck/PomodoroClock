# PomodoroClock

### A simple & customisable Pomodoro Clock

This is a little project of mine to work with timers and some DOM manipulation using 'vanilla' JS only.
The design could be improved, but all functionalities I wanted to include are there.

* You can start a 25 minute [pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), followed by a 5 minute break
* You can reset the timer at all times
* You can customise the length of each pomodoro
